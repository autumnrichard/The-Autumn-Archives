    <p>Hey there! My name is Autumn and I am the developer for this webpage! Welcome to my first-ever website!</p>
    <p>I'm filled with so much excitement anticipating the lessons that await me for coding school! I hope to take the skills I learn from there to create something great whether that be global or something as simple as a non-profit local.</p>
    <p>My favorite foods is a tie between ramen and sushi!</p>
